PCB Design Files for KiCAD

Because we decided to build a perfboard based on the Schematic for time, testing, and budget purposes, the PCB itself is unfinished. The Schematic, Ratnest, Part Selection, Footprint Design/Selection, etc.. is all finished. Since all the groundwork is complete, all the next person has to do is move around the footprints, connect the ratnest, and generate Gerbers. Should be quick and easy. I recommend using PCBWay to fabricate the boards.
